Rebuild a single-page landing page for the target audience below, applying the CRO analysis as requirements.

TARGET AUDIENCE:
small freelancers in india

SOURCE PAGE (for reference only):
https://www.wearelumo.com/

CRO ANALYSIS (apply strictly):
What's Working:
• Addresses pain points of freelancers stuck at low income (e.g., "Stuck at ₹5K clients?").
• Clear aspirational goal ("Zero to ₹5L/month Roadmap", "Get ₹50K - ₹1L clients").
• Highlights tangible benefits (e.g., "30+ ready DM & email scripts", "Confidently charge 2x-5x more").
• Relatable origin story of the founders ("Underpaid, overworked, and stuck").
• Strong mentor credibility with significant achievements and brand associations (e.g., "₹10 Crore+ in earnings", "Colgate, Budweiser", "Top-ranked on Upwork").
• Detailed listing of valuable course assets and support (e.g., "Freelancer Branding Blueprint", "Monthly Coaching Calls").
• Creates urgency and offers a clear discount with local currency pricing (e.g., "Limited slots", "₹7̶5̶0̶0̶ ₹1749").
• Addresses common objections effectively in the FAQ section.
• Uses culturally relevant pricing comparison ("Less than your last Swiggy + Starbucks weekend").

High-Impact Fixes:
• Excessive repetition of key headlines and benefit statements (e.g., "Stuck at ₹5K clients?" repeated 4 times).
• Redundant navigation links and "ENROLL NOW" buttons throughout the text.
• Inconsistent presentation of large monetary values (e.g., switching between "₹10 Crore+" and "$8,000+" projects).
• Generic module titles that could be more descriptive of their specific value (e.g., "Build Skills That Pay").
• Implied visual clutter due to extensive text duplication, which hinders readability.

Quick Adds:
• Specific testimonials or short case studies from Indian freelancers who have achieved results using the system.
• A clear, upfront satisfaction or money-back guarantee to reduce perceived risk.
• An FAQ addressing the estimated time commitment required for the course for busy freelancers.
• More specific examples of how the system applies to various digital skills beyond design (e.g., writing, marketing, development).
• Reinforce the value of the private community with examples of peer support and networking opportunities.

Remove / Reduce:
• All instances of the repeated text blocks beyond their first, most impactful occurrence (e.g., "Stuck at ₹5K clients?", "We started out like this…", "Then we built a simple system…").
• Duplicate navigation menus and "ENROLL NOW" buttons that appear excessively within the content.
• Any technical artifacts like '")" class="framer-lurrd" aria-hidden="true">' as these are rendering errors, not content.

DELIVERABLES:
1) Information architecture (ordered section list).
2) Wireframe spec per section (H1/H2, subcopy, bullets, primary CTA).
3) Final copy per section (ready-to-paste).
4) SEO: <title>, meta description.
